# 🏍️ BikeZone

**BikeZone** is a static bike showcase website built entirely by me — from writing the HTML and CSS code to designing the layout, selecting images, and writing all the content.

## 🖼️ Project Overview

BikeZone highlights different types of bikes in a clean and structured layout. It's designed as a desktop-first static website without responsive behavior for smaller screens.
